# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#     I18n.locale = :es
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by the default I18n backend:
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
